release notes
=============

vdev
----

new features:
- Finder context menu plugin with a "Open in Disk Inventory X" command for folders and volumes (must be installed manually in the preference window!)
- a new selection list which can show all files of a specific kind or all all files (to show the selection list, use the new context menu in the kind statistic or select menu "Window->Selection List").
- an option whether the assignment between colors and file kinds are shared between open windows or not (so every kind has in all windows the same color - like before - or the assignment is done for each window separately)
- performance improvements when dealing with a large number of files
- sortable columns in the kind statistic drawer (and in the new selection list, of course)
- a warning is shown prior deleting a file or folder on a network volume (items on a network volume can only be deleted, not moved to trash)

bug fixes:
- DIX crashed when refreshing a file or files if DIX has zoomed into a folder
- the "select parent" shortcut did not work if the file view had the focus: the shortcut is now changed to Apple-U (previously Command-P).



1.0 beta (2004-06-12)
---------------------
- now runs only under Mac OS X 10.3+; 10.2 is no longer supported!

new features:
- the scanning process is now 3 times faster (thanks to Dave Payne from Apple)
- show the free space and the space occupied by not shown files (on the selected volume) and like a file in the treemap
- show physical (# of used clusters) or logical (size of content) file size
- ignore creator code (so all those PDF files are shown as "PDF File" and not as "Acrobat PDF File" or "PDF File")
- option to use a small font in the file list and the file kind statistic drawer
- refresh (reload) all or an individual file or folder
- preferences
- toolbar

The source code for the tree map is now a separate framework to be easily integrated into other applications.
